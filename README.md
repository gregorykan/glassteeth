Overall description:

This app will be a data grabbing and visualization tool that centres on Twitter. It will be able to do static searches (retrospective) of the Twitter stream as well as "live" searches that query Twitter as tweets come in in real-time. The app will also feature sentiment analysis and word cloud (frequency) services, that are then mapped in geolocations via Google Maps.
